libll
=============

libll is a library for creating and working with linked lists. I wrote it
entirely for my own practice and knowledge. The goals for the development of
this library are both speed and comprehensive code.


Building
------------

Run `make` in the root directory to build a shared library. It will be placed
in `./bin/`, and named `libll.so`.


Testing
------------

To build and run the unit tests, run `make test`.
