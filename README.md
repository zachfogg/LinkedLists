libll
=============

libll is a library for creating and working with linked lists. I wrote it
entirely for my own practice and knowledge. The goals for the development of
this library are both speed and comprehensive code.


Building
------------

Run `make` in the root directory to build the project as a a shared library.
It will be placed in `./build/`, and will be named `libll.so`.


Documentation
------------

I will eventually write documentation for the functionality of this library.
For now, refer to to the header file ``./lib/ll.h` to see prototypes of
the available functions.


Testing
------------

To build and run the unit tests, run `make test`.
